A small website with responsive design - created by me

The website contains, but is not limited to: 
- Javascript written using JQuery
- JavaScript cookies which is set when you click accept on the "Cookies policy"-popup window.
  - The cookies saves the date of setting the cookies and its expiration date.
  - The cookies essentially just disables the popup window if you have click accept.
- Reducing the window width-size to 700px will change the desktop website into the mobile version.
  - The top menubar will change into a hamburger button.
    - The desktop menu options is accessable through here.
  - A home button will also appear.
- The ability for users to add items into short 5-item list.
  - When an item is added, a blurb text will be displayed which writes the size of the list, and about the recent item's first letter and it's total letter length.
- A form that provides feedback whenever the user doesn't fill in an input field.
  - Additionally shows an example, with an animated tooltip, on how the user should format their input depending on field.
    - E.g. the e-mail input field tooltip displays: mikaelherz@example.com
